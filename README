This is a mockup of OpenCell/YAPE/whatever in Scala. It is just a proof of concept, to compare against the actual XUL codebase and a Qt/C++ mockup.

This is an Eclipse project; it can also be built with just a scala compiler, but that would require significant effort.

It depends on SWT and JFace for the GUI toolkit, JEuclid for MathML rendering, and JFreeChart for graphing.
